# 1 Prerequisites

## 1.1 Functional Requirements

Requirements that **define what a system is supposed to do by describing the various functions that the system must perform**.

For example:
- A user authentication system must validate user credentials and provide access levels.
- An e-commerce website should allow users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete purchases.
- A report generation system must collect data, process it, and generate timely reports.

## 1.2 Non-functional Requirements

Requirements that **describe how the system performs a task, rather than what tasks it performs**. They are related to the quality attributes of the system.

For example:
- Scalability: The system should handle growth in users or data.
- Performance: The system should process transactions within a specified time.
- Availability: The system should be up and running a defined percentage of time.
- Security: The system must protect sensitive data and resist unauthorized access.

## 1.3 Functional and Non-functional Requirements in Interviws

When you are in a system design interview, you can handle these requirements by following these guidelines:
1. **Clarify requirements**: Start by asking questions to understand both functional and non-functional requirements. Interviewers often leave these vague to see if you will ask for more details.
2. **Prioritize**: Not all requirements are equally important. Identify which ones are critical for the system's success.
3. **Trade-offs**: Discuss trade-offs related to different architectural decisions, especially concerning non-functional requirements. For example, a system highly optimized for read operations might have slower write operations.
4. **Use real-world examples**: If you can, relate your points to real-world systems or your past experiences. This shows practical understanding.
5. **Balance**: Ensure you are not focusing too much on one type of requirement over the other. A well-rounded approach is often necessary. You should demonstrate that you can design a system that not only meets its functional goals but also performs effectively, securely, and reliably.

In system design interviews, interviewers are often interested in seeing how you think and approach problems, not just the final solution. Demonstrating a clear understanding of both functional and non-functional requirements is key to showing your comprehensive knowledge in system design.
