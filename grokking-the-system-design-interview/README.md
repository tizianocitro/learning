# Grokking the System Design Interview

## What is a System Design Interview?

The purpose of a system design interview is to assess a candidate's ability to design and understand complex and large-scale software systems.

System design questions are open-ended, meaning that there is not a single correct answer. The emphasis is on the approach and reasoning behind the designâ€‹. The goal is to evaluate how you think through large-scale problems and make engineering decisions.

In essence, they are to assess whether you can apply engineering knowledge to real-world system architecture challenges.
