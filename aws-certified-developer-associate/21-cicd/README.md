# 21 CICD: CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy

Manual steps (e.g., create AWS resources manually) make it very likely to do mistakes. We would like our code in a repository and have it deployed onto AWS:
- Automatically.
- Correctly.
- Making sure it is tested before being deployed.
- With possibility to go into different stages (e.g., dev, test, staging, prod)
- With manual approval where needed.

## 21.1 Technology Stack for CI/CD on AWS

For all of this, we need a **CI/CD pipeline**. AWS has several services to help us with this:
- `CodeCommit`: store code.
- `CodePipeline`: automate pipelines.
- `CodeBuild`: build and test code.
- `CodeDeploy`: deploy the code (no Elastic Beanstalk).
- `CodeStar`: manage software development activities in one place.
- `CodeArtifact`: store, publish, and share software packages.
- `CodeGuru`: automated code reviews using machine learning.
