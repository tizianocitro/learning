# 22 Serverless Application Model (SAM)

SAM is a **framework for developing and deploying serverless applications**.

All the configuration is YAML code that is used to generate complex CloudFormation.

SAM:
- Supports anything from CloudFormation: outputs, mappings, parameters, resources.
- Can use CodeDeploy to deploy Lambda functions.
- Can help run Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB locally.
